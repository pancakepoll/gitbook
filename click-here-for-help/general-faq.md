This FAQ page answers some of the more commonly asked questions from the PancakePoll community.

## Where can I view the PancakePoll roadmap?

You can [view our to-do list here, but don't call it a roadmap](https://roadmap.pancakepoll.com/roadmap).

## How do I connect my wallet to Binance Smart Chain and PancakePoll?

We have a [Connect Your Wallet to PancakePoll guide](../get-started/connection-guide.md) covering this in detail.

## What's the best wallet for PancakePoll?

It depends on your needs. We have an [in-depth guide to selecting and creating a wallet](../get-started/wallet-guide.md) that's right for you.

## Why is my transaction failing?

You can check the status of a transaction on [https://bscscan.com/](https://bscscan.com).

Our [Troubleshooting Errors guide](troubleshooting-errors.md) may have a solution for your problem if you're having issues.

You can also see our [Fixing Stuck Pending Transactions guide](broken-reference) if you have a stuck transaction.

## How do I get airdrops?

Whenever there is an official airdrop on PancakePoll it will be announced along with the requirements.

Please remember anyone can airdrop tokens to PancakePoll users since every transaction is public on BscScan. Be sure to do your own research when it comes to non-official airdrops. To protect your funds, we recommend you don't use a smart contract you don't understand from a source you don't trust.
