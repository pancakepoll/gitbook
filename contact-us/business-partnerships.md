## Egg Farms and Milk Pools

Farms incentivize users to provide liquidity for your trading pair by distributing PPOLL to your pair's LP Token holders.

Milk Pools are a way of distributing your tokens to BSC users who stake PPOLL in the pool.

These two products go hand-in-paw on PancakePool: when a project provides their tokens for a Milk Pool, we'll also create a Farm. If you're looking to distribute tokens and incentivize liquidity, get in touch.
