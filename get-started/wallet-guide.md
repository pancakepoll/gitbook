### Getting a private key from mobile to import to desktop

Token Pocket lets you use both a desktop and mobile wallet. This section will cover how to get your private key from your mobile wallet to import into your desktop wallet.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please be extremely careful with how you handle your private keys. Giving your private keys to someone will give them full access to your coins! Token Pocket is an open-source project and will use your private key to import your wallet. Even so, only use your private key with applications you trust and can verify are legitimate!
{% endhint %}

1. Tap the **Me **tab on the bottom ribbon and tap **Manage Wallets**.
2. On the next page, tap the **Binance Smart Chain** entry. Be careful not to tap the address part, or you‚Äôll only copy that to the clipboard instead.
3. When the menu appears, find and tap the **Export Private Key** option. Type in your password to get your private key.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**NEVER, in any situation, should you ever give someone your private key or recovery phrase ("seed phrase"). This will give someone complete access to your crypto! The genuine PancakePoll site and staff will never ask you to input your seed phrase.**
{% endhint %}

Now you have your private key ready to import your wallet into the desktop version of Token Pocket.
