# ‚¨Ü NFT Level Upgrade

To **upgrade** your NFTs you have to collect a particular amount of NFT with max Exp for each NFT.

Also, DuckArmy NFTs can be upgraded **only after you unstake** **them** from the NFT Staking Pool. For example, you need to have 6 NFTs with the max boost of 100 EXP of the 1st level NFTs to upgrade them. Then, six of your 1st level NFTs will become the 1 NFT of the 2nd level.

The next levels have almost the same scheme of upgrading:

* You need **5 max Exp** NFTs of the 2nd level to upgrade them to 1 NFT of **the 3rd level.**
* You need **4 max Exp** NFTs of the 3rd level to upgrade them to 1 NFT of **the 4th level.**
* You need **3 max Exp** NFTs of the 4th level to upgrade them to 1 NFT of **the 5th level.**
* You need **2 max Exp** NFTs of the 5th level to upgrade them to 1 NFT of **the 6th level.**

The number of required NFTs decreases by one as levels increase by one.

_The proper amount of your low-level NFTs is burned once you upgrade it to the next level. For example, 6 NFTs of the **1st** level turn into 1 NFT of the **2nd** level._
