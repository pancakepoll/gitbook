# ü¶Ü NFT Boost ( DuckBoost )

**DuckBoost** (DB) is a ‚Äúpower‚Äù of your NFT and a tool that helps you to boost your NFT, redeem DuckEgg and earn more crypto!



**How to get DB?**

What about getting the DuckBoost? The amount of DB you get depends on your trading volume: the more you swap Duck Token, the more DB you get!

Speaking technically, when you make a swap **Duck Token** or trade, you will be rewarded with DB that can be further used to boost your DuckNFT.

* You need to swap for **$100** volume to get 1 DB.

**How many DB is needed to get NFT ready to upgrade?**

NFTs of the first 5 levels can be exchanged for NFTs of the next level by collecting a certain number of the most pumped NFTs of a certain level.

To get one NFT of the 2nd level, the user needs to have **6 NFTs** of the **1st level** with **100 Duck Boost.**

For example:

* To get one NFT of the 2nd level, the user needs to have **6 NFTs** of the **1st level** with **100 Duck Boost.**
* To get one NFT of the 3rd level, the user needs to have **5 NFTs** of the **2nd level**, with **1000 Duck Boost.**
* To get one NFT of the 4th level, the user needs to have **4 NFTs** of the **3rd level**, with **10000 Duck Boost.**
* To get one NFT of the 5th level, the user needs to have **3 NFTs** of the **4th level**, with **100 000 Duck Boost.**
* To get one NFT of the 6th level, the user needs to have **2 NFTs** of the **5th level**, with **500 000 Duck Boost.**
