# Contributing

![](../../.gitbook/assets/NEWBAN.jpg)

PancakePoll is an open-source project. If you want to contribute to the project, this section is here to guide you through your first steps with the PancakePoll team ü•û

Before starting any development, we highly encourage you to submit an issue on Github in order to discuss the problem and the solution with the team. If you want to reach out to the dev team directly, [contact @AntonioPancakepoll](https://t.me/AntonioPancakepoll) on Telegram.

## Setup your dev environment

1. Fork the repository and an [add upstream remote](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork). E.g.

```
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:pancakepoll/pancakepoll-frontend.git
```

&#x20; 2\. Make sure you have the latest version of the default branch ( `develop` or `master` )

```
$ git checkout develop
$ git pull upstream develop
```

&#x20; 3\. Create your own branch and install dependencies

```
$ git checkout -b branch-name
$ yarn
```

&#x20; 4\. Happy coding üéâ
