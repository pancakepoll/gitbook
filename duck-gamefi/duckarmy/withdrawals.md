# üèß Withdrawals

In total there you can withdraw your funds from your earnings balance. Once you win the game and get rewarded with tokens you will be presented with multiple withdrawal options.

If you decide to withdraw your rewards the same day you received them, a fee of **27%** will be deducted. Every other day will cut the withdrawal fee by **1.5%** meaning that you will be able to withdraw your earnings **without any fee** in 18 days.

_Please note that if you decide to withdraw your earnings 6 days after you received them, you will pay a fee of 18% but the next withdrawal will bring you back to the initial commission of 27%._
{% endhint %}

In case of an early withdrawal (if it happens earlier than 18 days since you received the winnings), 10% of the fee charged will be allocated for burning, and 90% will be sent directly to the games reward pool.
