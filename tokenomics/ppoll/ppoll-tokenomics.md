## How to Confirm PPOLL Supply for yourself

To confirm that the circulating PPOLL supply shown on the PancakePoll homepage is correct,&#x20;

1. Head to the PPOLL token contract on BscScan and [see how much PPOLL is held by the Burn Address](https://bscscan.com/token/0xc29000a4b1ecd326b6dafae17bda636475fea1e7?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead). That's the total amount of PPOLL that's been burned (removed from circulation FOREVER, and impossible to ever retrieve).
2. Then, subtract this burned amount from the "Total Supply" that BscScan shows.
3. This gives you the actual PPOLLsupply.
