# PPOLL Tokenomics

## **Emission rate** <a href="emission-rate" id="emission-rate"></a>

### **Per block**

| **Metric**             | **Emission/block (PPOLL)** | **Emission/day (PPOLL)** |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------: | -----------------------: |
| Emission               |                        TBA |                      TBA |
| Burned Weekly          |                        TBA |                      TBA |
| **Effective Emission** |                  **TBA\*** |                **TBA\*** |

\*Effective Emission is in fact slightly below this amount: an additional (TBA) PPOLL per day is diverted from the amount allocated to the XXXX, and burned.

In addition to the above, a dynamic amount of PPOLL is also minted to the Dev address at a rate of TBA%. This means that if 100 PPOLL are harvested, then X.XX PPOLL is minted in addition and sent to the Dev Address.

## Distribution

|                                |                              |                            |            |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------- |
| Distributed to                 | Reward/block (% of emission) | Reward/block (total PPOLL) | Reward/day |
| Farms                          | TBA                          | TBA                        | TBA        |
| of which diverted and burned   | -                            | -                          | TBA        |
| Milk Pools                     | TBA                          | TBA                        | TBA        |
| **Total Daily PPOLL Emission** | -                            | -                          | TBA        |

As well as the above, PPOLL is also burned in the following ways:

* **xxx%** of every trade made on PancakeSwap V2
* **xxx%** of PPOLL spent on Profile Creation and NFT minting
* **xxx%** of PPOLL bid during Farm Auctions
* **xx,xxx** PPOLL per day (_The CAKE for this is generated by a farm - PID 137)_
* **xxx%** of every yield harvest in the Auto PPOLL Pool
* **xxx%** of every NFT sale on the NFT Market is used to buy PPOLL for burning

## How to Confirm PPOLL Supply for yourself

To confirm that the circulating PPOLL supply shown on the PancakePoll homepage is correct,&#x20;

1. Head to the PPOLL token contract on BscScan and [see how much PPOLL is held by the Burn Address](https://bscscan.com/token/#balances). That's the total amount of PPOLL that's been burned (removed from circulation FOREVER, and impossible to ever retrieve).
2. Then, subtract this burned amount from the "Total Supply" that BscScan shows.
3. This gives you the actual PPOLLsupply.
